      "IT Student | Soon-to-be Graduate in Information Systems Management

      Hello! I'm Allan Araujo, a passionate and driven student of Information Technology nearing the completion of my studies at Uni IPLUSO.
      Currently pursuing a degree in Information Systems Management, I've gained a strong foundation in various aspects of IT.
      Throughout my academic journey, I have delved into the intricacies of programming, honing my skills in languages like PHP, Python, SQLI, HTML.
      I've also garnered hands-on experience with databases, understanding how to design and manage them effectively. My coursework has provided me with a comprehensive
      grasp of project management, from conception to execution, as well as insights into the realms of projects, investments, and the broader field of information systems.
      As a dedicated learner, I've excelled in my studies and actively sought to apply my knowledge in practical settings. My time management and organizational skills,
      cultivated through coursework in project and information systems management, have contributed to my success as a student.
      I am eager to bring my diverse skill set and academic achievements into the professional sphere, where I aim to contribute
      to innovative projects and leverage my understanding of technology and management. Excited about the possibilities that lie ahead,
      I am actively seeking opportunities to further develop my expertise and make a meaningful impact in the dynamic field of Information Technology."
